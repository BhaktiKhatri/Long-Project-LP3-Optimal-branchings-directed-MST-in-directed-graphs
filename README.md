# Long-Project-LP3-Optimal-branchings-directed-MST-in-directed-graphs
Implement the algorithm discussed in class for finding minimum spanning trees in directed graphs (optimal branchings). The version that you need to implement was discussed in class as Tarjan's algorithm for optimal branchings, that was an improvement over the algorithms of Chu and Liu, and, Edmonds.
